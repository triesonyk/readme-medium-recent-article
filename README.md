## Introduction
Hi, I'm Sony. I was a lecturer of civil engineering before but in the year of 2022 I decided that I wanted to to do a career shifting to data-related field. I finished my Data Science study at [Rakamin Academy](https://www.rakamin.com/) as The Most Outstanding Student but after looking at what other people have created in Github, Medium and any other platforms, I realize that I still have a lot to learn so now I'm trying my best to learn more about Data and to create more portfolios. I also  like writing article and try to create an article at least once a month at medium. I really appreciated if you pay a visit to my Medium page and give your opinion about my writings.
